# SECURITY NOTICE

## API Keys Are Protected

✅ **Your API keys are safe!** The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore`, which means:
- It will NOT be uploaded to GitHub
- It stays only on your local machine
- No one else can see your API keys

## Before Pushing to GitHub

1. **Double-check** that `.env` appears in your `.gitignore` file (it already does ✓)
2. **Never** manually add `.env` to git
3. **Always** use `.env.example` to show others what keys are needed (without the actual keys)

## If You Accidentally Commit API Keys

If you ever accidentally commit API keys to GitHub:
1. **Immediately** regenerate all affected API keys in their respective dashboards
2. Remove the commit from GitHub history
3. The old keys will stop working once you regenerate them

## Your Current API Keys

You have API keys for:
- ✅ Anthropic Claude
- ✅ OpenAI
- ✅ Google Gemini
- ✅ Supabase (partial - still need anon/service keys)
- ✅ Field Elevate Database
- ✅ Redis
- ✅ MCP Auth Token

## Next Steps

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard → Settings → API
2. Copy the `anon` key and `service_role` key
3. Replace the placeholder text in your `.env` file

## For Team Members

When someone clones your repo, they should:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add their own API keys
3. Never commit the `.env` file
